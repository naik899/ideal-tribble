### ü§ñ **Intelligent Conversation Management**
- **Smart Agent Selection**: AI coordinator automatically selects 2-3 most relevant agents for each question
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Continuous, context-aware discussions that build over time
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Agents respond based on conversation history and cultural authenticity

### üí¨ **Interactive Commands**
- `help` - Show available commands and sample topics
- `agents` - View all agents and their cultural backgrounds  
- `clear` - Reset conversation history
- `quit` - Exit the application

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- OpenAI API key OR Azure OpenAI service

### Setup

1. **Set Environment Variables**:

   **For OpenAI:**
   ```bash
   # Windows Command Prompt
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
   
   # Windows PowerShell  
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
   $env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
   
   # Linux/Mac
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
   export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
   ```

   **For Azure OpenAI:**
   ```bash
   set AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_azure_key_here
   set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
   set AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
   set AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project GroupChatConsole/GroupChatConsole.csproj
   ```

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Start the Application** - You'll see a welcome message and prompt
2. **Ask Questions** - Type any philosophical or cultural question
3. **Get Diverse Responses** - The coordinator selects relevant agents to respond
4. **Continue the Conversation** - Build on previous responses with follow-up questions
5. **Use Commands** - Type `help` to see available commands

### üí° Sample Conversation Starters

```
What does a good life mean to you?
How do you balance tradition with progress?
What role should technology play in society?

You: What does success mean to you?

[Developer]:
Success for me is about creating innovative solutions that make people's lives easier while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. It's not just about climbing the corporate ladder, but about contributing meaningful code to projects that matter and having time for personal growth and relationships.

[SpiritualLeader]:
True success lies in serving others and growing closer to the divine. It's measured not by material possessions, but by the positive impact we have on our community, the wisdom we gain through spiritual practice, and how well we fulfill our moral obligations to help those in need.

[Farmer]:
Success means having healthy crops that feed my family and community, maintaining the land for future generations, and preserving the farming traditions passed down from my ancestors. It's about sustainability and being connected to the natural cycles of life.

You: How do these different views complement each other?
